1. external objects - couple of questions
2. 


knowledge check
---------------
Page 54
1. Picklist, number and text
2. sort and filter
3. false


1. section, visible, readonly
2. False. whatever availble in custom object by default it will be availe in mobile app by default
3. False
4. Create record, log a call

slide#88 is important - read it thoroghly

slide#89
1. False. When it's true we throw an error that's why it's false
2. False
3. False
4. True
5. False. You can't change on active approval process

slide#99
1. Fullcopy sandbox
2. Changeset
3. unmanaged package
4. Force.com migration tool
5. Developer Pro sandbox
6. IDE development wizard as you will have local copy.



Dev programming
---------------
admin@dex450.112.com

Programmatic devlopment using apex and visualforce



DEV450 - PD1 and PD2 certification

server logs we can't access. Developer log we can access.

Every primitive data type is considered as an object. IMPORTANT. eg: string, ID, number are all objects.


When you are writing code usins SOQL, you should always write it in square bracket.

Write SOQL query using anonymous windows
List<Account> accts=[select Name, Industry, billingcountry from Account];
for(Account a:accts)
{
    system.debug('Account Name: ' + a.Name);
    system.debug('Account PK: ' + a.id);
    system.debug('Account PK: ' + a.industry);
}


Query to return top 3 using SOQL
you can order by and set the offset. can use it without order by also.
SELECT Id, Name, Type, BillingCity FROM Account where BillingCity ='New York' offset 3
OR
this work with where clause, if the where clause doesn't return any value then in your apex u will get error whereas in query window no error will be thrown.
SELECT Id, Name, Type, BillingCity FROM Account where BillingCity ='New York' limit 4


1.Whenever you execute a SOQL query it returns SObject value.
2. Database.query is used to fire dynamic query eg: Database.query('select id, subject from Case where ' + criteria);  criteria will be criteria = 'ClosedDate < TODAY'
3. 









//TASK 2: Use Database.query() to repair the code from Task 1.
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Integer numDays = 10;
String selectClause = 'SELECT Id, Subject, CreatedDate ';
String fromClause = 'FROM Case ';

//      date literal, then concatenate the variable numDays to the string to complete the where clause.
String whereClause = ' where CreatedDate = LAST_N_DAYS:'+numDays;

List<Case> cases = Database.query(selectClause + fromClause + whereClause);
System.debug('Total number of cases: ' + cases.size());
for (Case c : cases) {
    System.debug(c);
}



//(OPTIONAL) TASK 3: Find records created using a particular record type.
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//TODO: Review the following code that returns the Id of a Record Type
Id productSupportId = Schema.SObjectType.Case.getRecordTypeInfosByDeveloperName().get('Product_Support').getRecordTypeId();

String selectClause = 'SELECT Id, Status, Subject ';
String fromClause = 'FROM Case ';

//TODO: Define a string, whereClause, that will be used in
System.debug(productSupportId);
string whereClause = ' where recordTypeId = \'' +  productSupportId + '\'';
List<Case> cases = Database.query(selectClause + fromClause + whereClause);
System.debug('Total number of cases: ' + cases.size());
for (Case c : cases) {
    System.debug(c);
}





CHILD TO PARENT 
1. Get firstname, lastname from contact and account name from account. Only  mapping records ot be return
SELECT Id, FirstName, LastName, Account.Name FROM Contact where Account.Id <> null

2. 
select name, certification__r.Name, Duration__c  
from course__c
where certification__c <> null


whenever u use soql in a list, you can update max of 200 update at a time. if the list object is outside the forloop then there is no restriction.

for(list<contact> cts:[select id from contacts]) - if this contains 300 rows
{
 list<contacts> newlist;
   for(contact c:cts) - fetch first 200
   {
	newlist.add(c)
   }
   update(newlist)
 list<contacts> newlist2;
   for(contact c:cts) - fetch remainig 100
   {
	newlist2.add(c)
   }
   update(newlist2)
}



option 2 - new restricton
list<contacts> newlist;
for(list<contact> cts:[select id from contacts]) - if this contains 300 rows
{
   for(contact c:cts)
   {
	newlist.add(c)
   }
}
update(newlist)

QUERY LIMITS
-------------
Total number of SOQL queries issued in a transaction
100
Total number of records retrieved by SOQL queries.
50000
Total heap size.
6mb




4 ways to pass data for testing
1. static files
2. factory
3. test data
4. seealldata attribute


150 DML statements can be executed.
when you have startTest() - this will provide 150 more additional goverance

Trigger best practices
======================
1 trigger for an object
modularity. Trigger should act like a traffic cop and add modularity to the trigger


Best practices with DML
1. 






to enable lightning page

settings > my personal information > advances user details > enable developer mode




chossing a custom controller vs controller extension
1. custom - no dependencies with any objects so custom
2. extension - it gets launches from another object so it should custom
3. custom- no dependencies with any objects so custom
4. Custom - here only navigation getting changed/changing the behaviour of save. So it's custom





SOQL vs SQQL
