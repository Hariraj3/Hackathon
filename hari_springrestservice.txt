1. space is not allowed.
2. no spring boot without rest
3. Git repository

Build and Project Management Tool: Maven
without maven spring boot is unmanagement

Gradle - based on groovy
Maven - integrated with eclipse

Java EE - Enterprise Edition., can be used to create enterprise edition which runs on app server.
UI - JSP, servlets
BL - EJB(enterprise Java bean)

java object represents row in a table is called EJB, enttity java bean

session bean - primary and premium objects.

without using app server want to build an app , comes the spring 

session bean - busines logic and it's replacement is spring.

spring, its another approach to create EE application withhout using EJB
design pattern are implemented by spring itself.

props is .net equaivalent to jave bean(get set property)

spring framework is alternate to Java EE to craete enterpise application.

Plain old java object(POJO) - simplrer java object.

spring mostly takes features frm thisr party.



Spring Framework - Basics
1. all popuplar design pattens are in build.
2. its uses IOC. It's dependency injecty container
3. leght weight
5.Service is available
3. can built al sort of app in business and data
5.can create interface 
6. replacemenet for EEBC
7. for every task  have bean
establish the contact between
8, chekec or unchked excaption
9. in rping api no nchecked box
10. 

API - application provider interface
sPI - 

Spring Framework has modules
1. Dependency container are called core module
2. in core module we conain  6 jars
3.core application doesn't required all modules.
4, spring has jars, Jars are characterized
5. DAO, OEM, GGG[, wb,AOPP and core
sptinr can suppot existing java ore
6. spring requires JVM to run
spring modules can have it in a container whih spring container



Spring Core
Spring main engine is IOC Container
it manages the life cycle of bean
1. need an xml file as a container to the spring
benefit: do not 
2. by default bean will be singleton.


Dependency will be injected through setter or constructor to the root.
All the beans or class will be configured thru xml.
once the xml is configured, feed the xml to context
1. Setter Injection
2. Constructor Injection



pom file
project object management file

maven is based on plugins



no more context, spring boot means annotations



<bean../>
@component - Helper clas Beans
@Service - Service Layer Bens
@Repository -  Data Layer Beans
@Controller = MYC Contraoller Beans
@Coniguration - Alternate to .xml config

@Bean -- for metod level declaration of beans.
